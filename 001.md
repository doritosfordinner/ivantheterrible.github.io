# Pseudo-simplicity

Our JavaScript application uses an open source library, let's call it `d` for the sake of obfuscation, to assist with domain-driven development.

If our application had a blog post domain it would be defined as follows:

```javascript
var d = require('ddd-module');

var Type = d.define({
  title: d.string,
  body: d.string,
  date: d.date
});


module.exports = {
  type: Type,
  createFromSourceA: function (raw) {
     var normalized = normalizer1(raw);
     return new Type(normalized);
  },
  createFromSourceB: function (raw) {
    var normalized = normalizer2(raw);
    return new Type(normalized);
  }
};
```

We need to add tags to our post domain.  Assuming that `tag` is a defined domain and has been imported as `tag`, the following adjustment would be made to the called to `d.define()`.

```javascript
var Type = d.define({
  title: d.string,
  body: d.string,
  date: d.date,
  tags: d.list(tag.type)
});
```

As you can see, `d.list` accepts a type.

Now, here's where things get a bit interesting.  Let's assume that there are different kinds of tags -- there are `tags`, `categories`, and `topics`.
